                    <p>You start looking over your victims with vicious eyes, but at the same time with regret of wasting your time. You thought you saw potential with these humans, but you saw nothing but pests that should not even exist. You started going on a rampage and destroying buildings and any vehicle in your way. Slowly destroying cities after cities, and then countries and countries. You do this in matter of minutes, and possibly less than that. You start salvaging electronics and repair your ship. You send a message back to Aiur about a planet you have just crashed in and completely destroyed. You wonder off into space thousands of light years away to hopefully come across a worthy planet where you fall in love with someone, or completely destroy and sell to your home planet...</p>
